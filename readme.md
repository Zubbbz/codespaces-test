# Container Thing
This is meant to be a proof of concept for containers. I don't know why I chose a discord bot, but its still super easy to use

Requirements
---
You need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) installed if on windows. You also need the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension pack for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Instructions
---
Clone the repo somewhere
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Zubbbz/codespaces-test.git
```
**Next:**
Open VS Code and using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> shortcut, open the repo using *"open folder in container"* command.
Note: The first time might take a while
